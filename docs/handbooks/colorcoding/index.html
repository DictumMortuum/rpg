<strong>Colorcoding</strong></header><article class=markdown><h1 id=colorcoding>colorcoding</h1><p>In the following guide I will be using the color coding that I introduced during the days of 3.5e in the wizards&rsquo; of the coast optimization forum. Unfortunately that guide is now lost, because the forum is defunct, but a forum poster named Clockwerk66 has posted it <a href=http://www.enworld.org/forum/showthread.php?471718-Handbook-to-Guide-Writing-(Dictum_Mortuum)>here</a>. Normally, I prefer three colors and a fourth one that&rsquo;s there to denote the best choices.</p><ul><li><navy><strong>navy</strong></navy>: this is a no-brainer. I use this sparingly.</li><li><blue><strong>blue</strong></blue>: this is a good choice. I use this more often.</li><li><strong>black</strong>: this is ok. Most items fall into this category.</li><li><red><strong>red</strong></red>: this is bad. I use this often.</li></ul><p>The character optimization community has picked up the color coding technique and it is now used in almost every optimization guide on the Internet, but every time I feel that people are not using it correctly.</p><p>My first issue, is too many colors. Three is easy to keep in your head. Some people are using 5 or 6 colors and this makes me scroll between the color code explanation and the item that I&rsquo;m currently reading. Often, the order doesn&rsquo;t make any sense, too: recently I was reading a guide where best was yellow, orange was next to worst and red was worst, but orange, yellow and red are really close in the color scale!</p><p>My second issue is lack of sufficient explanation. I&rsquo;m guilty of this myself a lot of times - sometimes the guide writer grades an item with a color, but the explanation is different - e.g. bad items described positively, which puts the reader off.</p><p>My third and final issue is not picking colors that are friendly to colorblind people. I am colorblind myself and I can&rsquo;t distinguish between green and red fonts - larger areas are much easier to figure out the color, but fonts requires a lot of concentration and I&rsquo;m still not 100% sure. This is why I chose blue, red and navy for those rare class staples - they are easy to read (compared to yellow or light green fonts) and work for everyone, even colorblind people!</p></article><div class="book-footer justify-between"><div><a href=https://github.com/DictumMortuum/rpg/commit/33ccf7cf12852f4a70fa43398cdb4e9316b23510 title="Last modified May 26, 2019 by Dimitris Raviolos" target=_blank rel=noopener><img src=/svg/calendar.svg alt=Changed> May 26, 2019</a></div><div><a href=https://github.com/DictumMortuum/rpg/edit/master/content/handbooks/colorcoding.md target=_blank rel=noopener><img src=/svg/edit.svg alt=Edit> Edit this page</a></div></div></div><aside class="book-toc fixed"><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><a href=#colorcoding>colorcoding</a></li></ul></nav></aside></main></body></html>
