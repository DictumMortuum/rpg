# the paladin's handbook

by Dimitris Raviolos

# Introduction 

## why paladin?

If someone asked me to bet on the {{< book "player's handbook" >}} class that most people would either love or hate, my money would be on the Paladin class. Most people have different feelings about it, but one thing is for sure: they are strong ones. Usually selected by new players, thinking that they will be able to play their dream-knight in shinning armor able to slay dragons, unfortunately they are usually left with a bitter disappointment.

The term *paladin* existed historically and has a slightly different meaning than its dungeons and dragons counterpart. According to [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paladin):

> In the medieval chanson de geste cycle of the Matter of France, the paladins or Twelve Peers are the twelve foremost knights of Charlemagne's court, comparable to the Knights of the Round Table in Arthurian romance.[1] They represent the valour of Christian chivalry against the Saracen invasion of Europe. [...] The term paladin is from Old French, ultimately from Latin palātīnus, the title given to the closest retainers of the Roman emperors.

In this guide i will try to explore the paladins and provide as many information as possible on them and hopefully, give the characters' of the readers a strong combat edge for their knightly adventures.

## moral dilemmas

Traditionally, in the previous editions of dungeons and dragons, the paladin was the base class out of {{< book "player's handbook" >}} that had the most strict alignment restriction. Thankfully, starting with the 3rd edition and 4th editions, this alignment restriction was slowly lifted and thus, paladins no longer are required to be of the lawful good alignment and to uphold the tenents of good and order.

They do however have a sacred oath that they have to follow and each one of them has its own tenets. A paladin who breaks his oath may atone, by seeking absolution from a cleric who shares his faith, or from a paladin from the same order. However, for paladins who are impenitent, there's also the oathbreaker paladin option that appears in the {{< book "dungeon master's guide" >}}.

Still, history is a very strong thing and people might still hold the position that paladins should be lawful good champions of what is true; for this reason I'd like to remind you that according to the {{< book "player's handbook" >}}, page 122:

> These brief summaries of the nine alignments describe the typical behavior of a creature with that alignment. **Individuais might vary significantly from that typical behavior, and few people are perfectly and consistently faithful to the precepts of their alignment.**

I have encountered people with different opinions on alignments that range from indifference to extremism. My personal view on alignment is that it's a good mechanic to determine the outcome of certain spells and effects and to give your character a roleplay direction. However, it is not a good mechanic to use if you want to resolve philosophical arguments on ethics or determine which NPC you should punish.

Ethics is a branch of philosophy that investigates questions like "Is this action right or wrong?". Philosophers like [Plato](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plato), [Immanuel Kant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immanuel_Kant) and [Friedrich Nietzche](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedrich_Nietzsche) have been trying to resolve questions like this for thousands or years. Based on these facts, it's understandable that these ethical questions are not going to be solved by the alignment system.

The problem here lies in the simplicity of the alignment system. It uses two axes - good/evil and law/chaos, which is suitable for a fantasy game like Dungeons and Dragons; the alignment system tries to make choices simple and not complicated. 

Thus, I feel that removing the mechanical implications from the paladin in this 5th edition (e.g. code of conduct) was the right thing to do, as the simplicity of the alignment system and the ambiguity of the code didn't mix well.

If you want to play a paladin and your party is cool about it, then great. If you feel that your dungeon master or teammates are punishing you because of your class choice, this is not cool and you should have a talk about it. Remind them that, according to the rules, alignment is not meant to restrict your character and that it should not be taken far too seriously. You are playing a paladin for style after all, you are not

# attributes

Determining the attribute spread for your character might feel a little daunting at first and with good reason - because paladins are a little bit of everything, they have some spellcasting, they are fighters, they get to be the face of the party and finally have some class features that boost the party.

To best determine what would be the best ability stat array for a paladin, two questions have to be answered first. One, what's the starting level and two, how much will this campaign last.

It's all about practical optimization. Yes, all paladins would benefit from having 20 charisma instead of 14 charisma, but a more balanced approach would be more beneficial to a paladin starting from level 1 or 2, compared to spending most of your point buy points to a single stat.

A paladin that is less than level 6 doesn't care all that much about how high his charisma is, aside from a small bonus to his charisma-related skills or a low level spell that allows for a saving throw; low levels are all about your {{< feature "fighting style" >}} and {{< feature "divine smite" >}}.

Another example - a paladin starting on level 16 would afford a full plate and would completely dump dexterity; whereas a lower level paladin would most probably have to compromise by getting a score of about 14 in dexterity and donning a breastplate.

Finally, with the introducting of the items that don't boost the attributes, but they set them to a certain score, it's now possible to completely dump an attribute that would otherwise be dimmed as important.

- {{< blue strength >}}: The paladin class already offers access to heavy armor, so you need to at least spend some points to make the strength requirement, if you want to use them. Strength is most likely to determine the attack and damage roll of your weapon, there are a lot of good melee options available to paladins, since they get proficiency with all weapons. Paladins also get heavy armor proficiency and most high level armor options have a minimum strength requirement.
- {{< black dexterity >}}: In this edition of dungeons and dragons boosts a lot of different options; you use it to determine your attack and damage rolls with certain weapons (ranged or finesse ones), initiative, armor class and dexterity saves, which occur quite often. So switching to dexterity for your primary fighting attribute would be an option open to the paladin, but, alas, {{< feature "divine smite" >}} doesn't work with ranged weapons.
- {{< blue constitution >}}: I would argue that no matter the character, this is the most important attribute. It will bump a paladdin's constitution checks, including some important saves versus petrification, death and poison as well as concentration checks.
- {{< red intelligence >}}: This is the attribute that a paladin may safely dump, it is quite rare as a saving throws and there is little synergy with features and skills.
- {{< black wisdom >}}: It used to be that the paladin casted spells using the wisdom attribute. However, the 5th edition paladin uses charisma as a base attribute for their spells, which is important for reducing multiple attribute dependency. Now, paladins are also proficient in wisdom saving throws, which appears quite often. It's tempting to completely dump this attribute and it is possible, but note that there are a couple of useful skills that are boosted by wisdom, like insight and perception.
- {{< navy charisma >}}: A paladin has high charisma synergy via his class features. This determines the save DC of his spells, the number of uses of {{< feature "cleansing touch" >}} and {{< feature "diving sense" >}}, the power of {{< feature "aura of protection" >}} and finally, it boosts a lot of skills that are based on charisma, like intimidation or persuation. This is the main attribute of a paladin, so it's the highest priority.

# races

## common

{{< black dwarf >}}

There are a few of the abilities that dwarves provide that overlap with the class features that the class provides, for example {{< feature "dwarven combat training" >}} is completely redundant to a class that already has all the proficiencies and the same holds for the ability that {{< feature "mountain dwarves" >}} have, namely {{< feature "dwarven armor training" >}}. I understand that this race was designed with the idea that whatever the class, a dwarf is able to don heavy armor and use the race's signature weapons.

However, the dwarf race offers some benefits to a paladin. For starters, it has some useful defensive features, such as the +2 constitution score and {{< feature "dwarven resilience" >}}.

Another thing is that dwarves don't get reduced speed for wearing heavy armor, even though their starting speed is 5ft less to somewhat offset thing bonus, so a paladin that plans on eventually wearing full plate armor or half plate armor offsets the speed penalty.

- {{< black "hill dwarf" PHB >}}: Wisdom bonus and more hit points. Decent choice if you want to be a dwarf, but {{< feature "mountain dwarf" >}} is a slightly better choice.
- {{< blue "mountain dwarf" PHB >}}: One of the rare races that provides a +2 bonus to two attributes, boosting both strength and constitution. Unfortunately aside from sheer numbers, it doesn't offer anything else, as {{< feature "dwarven armor training" >}} is completely redundant for a paladin.
- {{< red "gray dwarves (durgar)" SCAG >}}: Even though they get a good package with bonuses to strength, resistances to illusions and charm via {{< feature "duergar resilience" >}} and magic, {{< feature "sunlight sensitivity" >}} is too harsh.

{{< red elf >}}

Unfortunately, there's not much that the elf race offers for a paladin build. They do have proficiency in the perception skill via the {{< feature "keen senses" >}} feature, they are resistant to sleep magic and against being charmed via {{< feature "fey ancestry" >}} and finally they are able to benefit from a long rest after only 4 hours of sleep, because of their {{< feature trance >}} ability, but that's basically it.

A paladin would probably benefit from the dexterity bonus if the campaign starts at the low levels, but it's not a very good fit.

- {{< red "high elf" PHB >}}: High elves have intelligence synergy, which is a dump stat for a paladin.
- {{< red "wood elf" PHB >}}: This subrace is a bit similar to dwarves, in the sense that due to the increased walking speed, the heavy armor proficiency will be offset. However, no other feature that the race provides would be useful to a paladin build.
- {{< red "dark elf (drow)" PHB >}}: Drow do have some charisma synergy, as they boost charisma, albeit at just +1, and have some spells that use charisma as the spellcating ability via their {{< feature "drow magic" >}} ability. However, {{< feature "sunlight sensitivity" >}} is really harsh and even without it there are far better choices for a paladin than these.

{{< red halfling >}}

Features-wise, halflings are something between an elf and a dwarf. On the one side they are clearly dexterity based, but they have some good defensive features, like {{< feature lucky >}}, which is incredibly potent.

{{< feature lucky >}} might be good to warrant picking halfling for a paladin build, however the rest of the race features do not have good synergy with the class, even for dexterity based builds.

- {{< red lightfoot PHB >}}: The charisma ability score increase is good, but {{< feature "naturally stealthy" >}} is weird.
- {{< red stout PHB >}}: Having {{< feature "stout resilience" >}} seems good, but the dwarf race offers pretty much the same thing, but with better attribute bonuses.

{{< black human >}}

The human race is all about maximizing your attributes, since they get a +1 bonus to all of them.

By being a human you can do 14/10/14/11/14/16 or 14/14/14/11/14/14, which is probably the most optimal spreads for a 27 point buy and as such it's perfect for a paladin in a low-level adventure.

However, besides that, it doesn't offer all that much; there are no other special abilities.

{{< navy "variant human" >}}

The variant human is an option that's probably the best race in the game, second to none.

It's the only race that offers the choice of a feat and that is available from level 1. Other races need to wait until level 4 to acquire a certain feat. As there are builds that require one or two feats to be effective, the {{< feature "variant human" >}} is able to bring the build online 4 levels earlier, which is a lot.

Additionally, {{< feature "variant human" >}} offers a free skill and two ability score improvements to any two attributes. The attributes is going to be some combination of strength/constitution/charisma and the free skill is probably going to be perception. This, coupled with the feat is probably the most that it's possible to get out of a race.

## uncommon

{{< blue dragonborn >}}

Dragonborns were probably created with the intent of becoming paladins. They have a dragon theme and they also are associated with Bahamut, the lawful good god of dragons.

They receive bonuses to strength and charisma, which is very good. They also have the feature {{< feature "damage resistance" >}}, which makes them resistance to the damage type associated with their {{< feature "draconic ancestry" >}}. Resistance to damage, especially for a type that appears often, like fire, is a very good thing to have, defensively.

{{< feature dragonborn >}} characters have a {{< feature "breath weapon" >}}, which has a constitution based save DC and additionally scales according to the {{< feature dragonborn >}}'s level. This feature is not powerful, but it's helpful during the lower levels and additionally it's rechargeable after a short or a long rest.

{{< feature dragonborn >}} characters have access to the {{< feature "dragon fear" XGtE >}}, a feat which provides an ability score improvement to one of the important paladin attributes (strength, constitution or charisma) and it makes it able to roar instead of using the {{< feature "breath weapon" >}}, with a charisma based save DC. Creatures who fail this check become frightened, which makes this ability quite good, because it makes a {{< feature dragonborn >}} character use its {{< feature "breath weapon" >}} during the higher levels.

Another feat available to {{< feature dragonborn >}}s is {{< feature "dragon hide" XGtE >}}, which unfortunately is mediocre.

{{< navy half-elf >}}

Arguably second only to the {{< feature "variant human" >}}, the {{< feature half-elf >}} is a race that is able to provide ability score improvements to all attributes necessary to a paladin (+1 strength/+1 constitution/+2 charisma).

They have some of the abilities that the elves have, like {{< feature darkvision >}} or {{< feature "fey ancestry" >}}, but their real power comes from the ability to gain proficiency in two skills of their choice via {{< feature "skill versatility" >}}.

- {{< black aquatic SCAG >}}: Instead of {{< feature "skill versatility" >}}, gain a swimming speed of 30ft. This is very useful in an aquatic campaign and it most definitely is a worthy trade.
- {{< black drow SCAG >}}: This depends a bit on the starting level of the character. At the early levels the ability to cast {{< feature "faerie fire" >}} is very helpful, as it's a source of attack roll advantage. In later levels, the skills are better.
- {{< black wood SCAG >}}: The most useful ability from the list is most certainly {{< feature "fleet of foot" >}}, which will help to offset the heavy armor penalty to a paladin build, pretty much like dwarves.
- {{< blue "high/moon" SCAG >}}: Marked blue only for the ability to get the {{< feature cantrip >}} feature. There are quite a few utility options here that make the extra two skills obsolete; for instance, {{< feature prestidigitation >}} is a very useful cantrip. There are also {{< feature "booming blade" SCAG >}} and {{< feature "green fire blade" SCAG >}}, but these do not work with the extra attacks that the paladin class gets.

{{< blue half-orc >}}

{{< feature half-orc>}}s are a good choice for a paladin that wants to focus more on the martial side of the class; they get ability score improvements in strength and constitution, a free skill and darkvision, but they are interesting because of the other two racial abilities that they have: {{< feature "relentless endurance" >}} and {{< feature "savage attacks" >}}.

The first has a bit of synergy with the class features of a paladin, as instead of being reduced to 0 hit points, the character gets to act again and he'll be able to recover a bit of hit points by using the {{< feature "lay on hands" >}} ability.

The second only applies to critical hits and it shouldn't come into play very often, but it's nice to have.

{{< black tiefling >}}

A paladin won't get the same mileage from {{< feature tiefling>}}s that they'll get by {{< feature "variant human" >}} or {{< feature half-elf >}}, however, they can be at least decent.

The highlights of this race are that it boosts charisma and has resistance to fire damage via {{< feature "hellish resistance" >}}. It also offers some low-level spellcasting based on charisma, including {{< feature thaumaturgy >}} cantrip and the {{< feature "hellish rebuke" >}} spell.

# class features

## core

All in all, the paladin class has a good package. The hit die is a standard d10 that most martial classes get and it's second only to that of the barbarian class. Proficiency with all weapons, all armor and shields gives the paladin class some versatility, unfortunately they don't receive any tools proficiencies.

It starts to get a bit weird when you look at the saving throw proficiencies that the paladin gets. In this edition, the paladin class may add his proficiency bonus on wisdom and charisma checks. Now both of them are quite important, for instance, wisdom appears the most number of times as a saving throw, probably right after dexterity. Charisma isn't as popular, but it's used to avoid some debilittating effects, so it can be very useful to a paladin.

However, the saving throw that is missing from the core paladin chassis is quite possibly constitution, which even though is understandable, as the starting classes from {{< book "player's handbook" >}} receive one *basic* saving throw (dexterity, constitution or wisdom) and a *secondary* one (strength, intelligence or charisma), would be more than welcome, because a paladin is both a character with a place in the frontline and a spellcaster. Both of these roles benefit from a proficiency with constitution checks, because they need to be able to resist physical effects that warrant one, like saves versus poison or death and it'd help them with concentration checks.

Thankfully, there are ways around this restriction and one of them is actually built into the class. Starting with level 6, paladins get access to {{< feature "aura of protection" >}}, a class feature that enables them to add their charisma modifier to any saving throw they make.

## skills

A paladin gets two skills from his base class, but he may extend the list by carefully selecting a background or a race.

Speaking of backgrounds, there's a certain rule on page 125 of {{< book "player's handbook" >}}:

> If a character would gain the same proficiency from two different sources, he or she can choose a different proficiency of the same kind (skill or tool) instead.

You can use this rule to your advantage when picking up a background. Most of the backgrounds offer a standard set of skills, so if you pick a background which offers two skills that you've already picked from the paladin list, then you are free to pick any two other skill proficiencies.

- {{< navy athletics >}}: One of the most useful skills in the paladin arsenal, the athletics skill will prove to be useful when you attempt to climb, swim, jump, force a lock open, or generally do something that requires a lot of strength. In addition, strength will enable you to use the grapple and shove actions, which are both very useful for battlefield control, especially during the early levels. Finally, this is important even if you are on the defensive, as these maneuvers are resisted either by dexterity(acrobatics) or by strength(athletics).
- {{< black insight >}}: Useful skill for trying to determine the true intentions of someone. Unfortunately this falls under the wisdom category, which is not going to be your strongest one. I've met a lot of dungeon masters that reward high rolls of this skill with a lot of useful information; if you think that your dungeon master is one of these types, then get it, even if your wisdom score is low.
- {{< black intimidation >}}: In the 3.5 edition this used to be an important asset for the classes that had charisma synergy. Unfortunately, now you cannot use it to demoralize your opponents - it provides only non-mechanical functions that can be used outside the battle mostly. Still, this will give your paladin a lot of style points, especially for members of certain oaths.
- {{< red medicine >}}: You can use it to try and stabilize a dying companion or diagnose an illness. This is situationally useful and the fact that you can use spells or {{< feature "lay on hands" >}} to stabilize someone that needs medical attention makes this not the first priority for a paladin.
- {{< blue persuation >}}: Like intimidation, it's no longer useful in battle skill, however it will provide your character with a lot of style points; it's good to have an aptitude with the activities that people expect a paladin to be proficient with. I consider this better than intimidation, because you can cover most of the things you can do with that by using persuation.
- {{< black religion >}}: This is the only knowledge skill on the list. You are probably not going to have a high level of intelligence, but it can be useful if you want your paladin to have a more academic approach towards religion.

Other skills that you should be targeting, either provided by your race, background, or using the trick discussed above are:

- {{< navy perception >}}: This is probably the most important skill in the game, just because no matter what class you are, your dungeon master will call for a perception check sooner or later.
