# the paladin's handbook

by Dimitris Raviolos

# Introduction 

## why paladin?

If someone asked me to bet on the Player's Handbook class that most people would either love or hate, my money would be on the Paladin class. Most people have different feelings about it, but one thing is for sure: they are strong ones. Usually selected by new players, thinking that they will be able to play their dream-knight in shinning armor able to slay dragons, unfortunately they are usually left with a bitter disappointment.

The term *paladin* existed historically and has a slightly different meaning than its dungeons and dragons counterpart. According to [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paladin):

> In the medieval chanson de geste cycle of the Matter of France, the paladins or Twelve Peers are the twelve foremost knights of Charlemagne's court, comparable to the Knights of the Round Table in Arthurian romance.[1] They represent the valour of Christian chivalry against the Saracen invasion of Europe.
> [...]
> The term paladin is from Old French, ultimately from Latin palātīnus, the title given to the closest retainers of the Roman emperors.

In this guide i will try to explore the paladins and provide as many information as possible on them and hopefully, give the characters' of the readers a strong combat edge for their knightly adventures.

## moral dilemmas

Traditionally, in the previous editions of dungeons and dragons, the paladin was the base class out of player's handbook that had the most strict alignment restriction. Thankfully, starting with the 3rd edition and 4th editions, this alignment restriction was slowly lifted and thus, paladins no longer are required to be of the lawful good alignment and to uphold the tenents of good and order.

They do however have a sacred oath that they have to follow and each one of them has its own tenets. A paladin who breaks his oath may atone, by seeking absolution from a cleric who shares his faith, or from a paladin from the same order. However, for paladins who are impenitent, there's also the oathbreaker paladin option that appears in the Dungeon Master's Guide.

Still, history is a very strong thing and people might still hold the position that paladins should be lawful good champions of what is true; for this reason I'd like to remind you that according to the Player's Handbook, page 122:

> These brief summaries of the nine alignments describe the typical behavior of a creature with that alignment. **Individuais might vary significantly from that typical behavior, and few people are perfectly and consistently faithful to the precepts of their alignment.**

I have encountered people with different opinions on alignments that range from indifference to extremism. My personal view on alignment is that it's a good mechanic to determine the outcome of certain spells and effects and to give your character a roleplay direction. However, it is not a good mechanic to use if you want to resolve philosophical arguments on ethics or determine which NPC you should punish.

Ethics is a branch of philosophy that investigates questions like "Is this action right or wrong?". Philosophers like [Plato](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plato), [Immanuel Kant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immanuel_Kant) and [Friedrich Nietzche](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedrich_Nietzsche) have been trying to resolve questions like this for thousands or years. Based on these facts, it's understandable that these ethical questions are not going to be solved by the alignment system.

The problem here lies in the simplicity of the alignment system. It uses two axes - good/evil and law/chaos, which is suitable for a fantasy game like Dungeons and Dragons; the alignment system tries to make choices simple and not complicated. 

Thus, I feel that removing the mechanical implications from the paladin in this 5th edition (e.g. code of conduct) was the right thing to do, as the simplicity of the alignment system and the ambiguity of the code didn't mix well.

If you want to play a paladin and your party is cool about it, then great. If you feel that your dungeon master or teammates are punishing you because of your class choice, this is not cool and you should have a talk about it. Remind them that, according to the rules, alignment is not meant to restrict your character and that it should not be taken far too seriously. You are playing a paladin for style after all, you are not
