# strength

The paladin class already offers access to heavy armor, so you need to at least spend some points to make the strength requirement, if you want to use them.

Strength is most likely to determine the attack and damage roll of your weapon, there are a lot of good melee options available to paladins, since they get proficiency with all weapons.
