## buy-in

*keep your character involved in the story*

The "buy-in" rule from {{< rpg "Feng Shui 2" >}} makes the player responsible of keeping his character involved in a story, instead of the game master.

If the game master says "There's a fire over at the museum", the players need to figure out a reason that their character would want to check that out and get involved. A valid reason could be anything from "My cousin works there!" to "Clues to the rare artifact I seek to break the curse slowly killing my village are there.".

No one knows or understdands a character better than the person that created it, game master not excluded. Thus, the buy-in rule is an ingenius method, because it achieves two things. First, the game master's job gets easier, because he doesn't need to come up with good excuses for every player. Second, the players feel that their characters are better integrated in the story and they can even add their personal touch.
